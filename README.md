# JSChronoClock - Analog Clock using Pure JavaScript

This project is a simple analog clock built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock dynamically updates every second to reflect the current time.

## Files in the Repository
- **index.html**: Defines the structure of the clock, including the clock container and hands (hour, minute, second).
- **index.css**: Styles the clock, positions the hands, and sets the clock background.
- **index.js**: Contains the logic to update the clock hands based on the current time.
- **clock.png**: Background image of the clock face.

## Functionality
- The clock hands move in real-time using JavaScript's `setInterval` method.
- The hour, minute, and second hands rotate based on the current time.
- Uses `transform: rotate(deg)` to update hand positions dynamically.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.
3. The clock will start running automatically.

Feel free to modify and enhance the project!
